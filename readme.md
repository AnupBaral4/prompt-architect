## 👋 Hey there!

I'm **Anup**, and I built **Prompt Architect** to make creating AI art prompts way easier. If you've ever struggled with writing the perfect prompt for Midjourney or DALL-E, this tool is for you!

Instead of typing out long, complex prompts, you can just click through categories, adjust some sliders, and boom – you've got a professional-grade prompt ready to copy.

### 🤖 Built with AI Assistance

**Full transparency:** I had the vision and design ideas for this project, but I used AI tools to help bring it to life. Here's how:

- **💡 Concept & Design:** 100% my ideas – I knew exactly what I wanted
- **🎨 Visual Design:** I described the industrial/cyberpunk aesthetic I envisioned, AI helped code it, then I refined it further with my feedback
- **💻 Code Implementation:** AI wrote the code based on my detailed specifications and requirements
- **✍️ Content Writing:** I outlined what to say, AI helped rewrite and polish the copy
- **🔄 Iterative Process:** Constant back-and-forth – I'd say "make this greener," "add hover effects," "change the layout," and AI would implement it

**Think of it like this:** I'm the architect (pun intended 😄), AI is the builder. I drew the blueprints, AI helped construct it, and I oversaw every detail.

**Why share this?** Because I believe in transparency. AI tools are powerful collaborators, but the creative vision, decisions, and direction are still human – that's me. This is how modern development works, and I'm not hiding it.

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Flow:

1. **Type your subject** (e.g., "cyberpunk city")
2. **Click attributes** from categories (Style, Mood, Lighting, etc.)
3. **Adjust parameters** (aspect ratio, stylize slider, chaos)
4. **Add negative prompt** if you want to exclude things
5. **Copy the final prompt** and paste into Midjourney/DALL-E

### Quick Start with Blueprints:

1. Scroll to "Neural Blueprints"
2. Click any card (CYBER_CITY, ETHEREAL_SOUL, or BRUTALIST_FORM)
3. Everything auto-fills – modify or use as-is
4. Copy and go!

## 🔧 Want to Run It Locally?

### Clone & Open:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnupBaral4/prompt-architect.git
cd prompt-architect
```

Then just open `index.html` in your browser. That's it! No build process, no npm, no hassle.

### Deploy Your Own:
Works on any static host:
- **Vercel** (what I use)
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Cloudflare Pages**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I wanted this to feel like a professional tool, not a toy. So I went with:

- **Dark theme** (easier on the eyes)
- **Industrial aesthetic** (sharp edges, tech-noir vibes)
- **Green accent** (that emerald color 🟢)
- **Micro-animations** (everything feels responsive)
- **No clutter** (clean, focused interface)

---

## 🔒 Privacy First

- ✅ Everything runs in your browser
- ✅ No databases, no servers storing your prompts
- ✅ No tracking (except basic Google Analytics for visitor counts)
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ No data collection

Your creative ideas stay yours.

## 🗺️ What's Next

### Coming Soon:
- More neural blueprint templates
- Export/import prompt collections
- Share prompts via URL
- Dark/light theme toggle

### Maybe Later:
- Stable Diffusion support
- Community blueprints
